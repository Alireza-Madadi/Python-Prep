# Python-Prep: A Curated Project Portfolio

Welcome! This repository isn't a random collection of homework scripts; it's a curated showcase of my best project-based work, demonstrating specific skills in Python, backend development, and software architecture.

These projects were developed as part of the **Quera College Advanced Python and Object-Oriented Thinking** course. Each project is fully documented, tested, and structured as a professional Python package.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

Here are the high-quality, fully-tested projects included in this repository:

### 1\. QMDB: SQLAlchemy ORM & Query Engine

A complete data-access layer for a movie database, similar to IMDB. This project demonstrates a deep understanding of database design, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), complex JOIN and GROUP BY queries, and the "Manager Pattern" for clean, testable logic.

- **Core Concepts:** SQLAlchemy ORM, Complex Relationships (1-M, M-M), Advanced Queries (func.avg, group_by), Manager Pattern, Unit Testing
- **Tech Stack:** Python, SQLAlchemy, unittest
- [**➡️ Dive into the code and architecture**](http://github.com/Alireza-Madadi/Python-Prep/QMDB/README.md)

### 2\. The Multiplayer Snake Game

The classic Snake game, refactored with a full client-server architecture. This project showcases skills in network programming, concurrency, data serialization, and object-oriented game design.

- **Core Concepts:** Client-Server Architecture, Socket Programming, Threading (for server), Data Serialization (json), OOP, Pygame
- **Tech Stack:** Python, socket, threading, json, pygame
- [**➡️ Dive into the code and architecture**](http://github.com/Alireza-Madadi/Python-Prep/multiplayer_snake/README.md)

### 3\. Secure Account Management System

A robust, self-contained module for user registration and login. This project focuses on security and advanced Python features, demonstrating secure password hashing, comprehensive input validation with RegEx, and the use of custom Decorators.

- **Core Concepts:** Password Hashing (hashlib), Input Validation (RegEx), Custom Decorators, OOP, Unit Testing
- **Tech Stack:** Python, hashlib, re, unittest
